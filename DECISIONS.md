# DECISIONS.md

Decisions that change or clarify the plan, plus an end-of-session log. Newest last.

## 2026-11-04 — Plan review → PLAN.md v1.1

- Claude Code's first review led to PLAN.md v1.1: Python pinned to 3.12; gitleaks CLI (not the Action); walking-skeleton milestone; explicit tagging rule and `EXEMPT_FIELDS`; harvest-year season convention; batched physics targets; forecast + forced hindcast modes; accepted boundary leakage; HLS true-colour basemap.
- Kluger, Di Tommaso & Lobell (2025), arXiv:2506.02384 — marked "confirmed by the planning research" in PLAN.md; **UNVERIFIED by Claude Code** until the paper is opened in T5.4.

## 2026-11-04 — T0.1 scaffold choices

- Secret scan: gitleaks v8.30.1. Locally via the `gitleaks-system` pre-commit hook (uses the installed binary, no Go toolchain). In CI the pinned Linux binary is downloaded and checked against the release checksums file, then scans full git history.
- Versions pinned from `git ls-remote` on 2026-11-04: ruff-pre-commit v0.17.3, actions/checkout v7.0.1, astral-sh/setup-uv v10.3.3.
- Source subpackages (`data/`, `physics/`, …) are created by the task that first needs them, not as empty placeholders.
- winget installs of uv and gitleaks hung (likely a hidden elevation prompt); installed uv via `pip install --user uv` and gitleaks from the checksum-verified GitHub release zip instead.
- Incident: ruff 0.17 formats Python code blocks inside Markdown; the ruff-format hook rewrote the PLAN.md §3 schema block (and moved a comment). Restored the original text; ruff now excludes `*.md` (plus `.agents/`, `.claude/`) with `force-exclude = true`.
- The upstream `gitleaks-system` remote hook failed on Windows ("accepts at most 1 arg(s), received 2"); the identical command as a `repo: local` hook passes. Using the local hook.
- `.gitattributes` forces LF so Windows and Linux CI agree on formatting.

## Session log — 2026-11-04

- Done: CLAUDE.md + PLAN.md v1.1 saved; T0.1 scaffold built; locally `pytest` (1 passed), ruff check/format, and pre-commit (ruff + gitleaks) all pass. No commit made yet.
- Blocked: T0.1 acceptance needs CI green on GitHub → needs a GitHub repo and permission to commit and push. T0.2/T0.3 need `~/.netrc` with Earthdata credentials.
- Next: finish T0.1 (push, CI green), then T0.2.
